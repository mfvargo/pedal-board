# pedal-board

Looking for a digital pedal board?  Something that will let you build a stack of  
effects to process audio, make adjustments, and save the results?  The PedalBoard is  
designed to let you do that.

This crate came out of a separate project to allow for real time multi-person audio  
conferecing.  A feature of that project was to allow users to create software pedal boards
for their channels that they could apply to their audio streams.  For example a nice reverb
for their vocal channel and some various effects for an instrument channel.
